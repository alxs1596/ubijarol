                    <h1 align="center">Importance</h1>
                    <p align="justify">The study of cancer genomes has revealed anomalies in the genes that drive the formation and growth of many types of cancer. This knowledge has improved our understanding of cancer biology and has led to new methods of diagnosing and treating the disease. For example, the discovery of genetic and epigenetic changes that cause cancer in tumors has allowed the formulation of targeted therapies. to these changes as well as diagnostic tests that identify patients who can benefit from these therapies.</p>

                    <h1 align="center">Opportunities</h1>
                    <p align="justify">Although a large number of genetic alterations that drive the formation and progression of many types of cancer have been identified through research studies, some types of tumors have not been characterized in depth. New technologies and insights gained from previous genomic studies could be used to define the full set of driving mutations and other alterations to DNA and RNA in many cancers. Studies comparing the genomic information of tumors and normal tissue from the same patient allow researchers to discover genomic changes that can boost cancer.</p>

                    <h1 align="center">Challenges</h1>
                    <p align="justify">A complete analysis of cancer genomes has revealed a lot of diversity in genetic abnormalities among cancers of only one type. Moreover, the recurrent genetic alterations within these cancers are included in only a small percentage of cases. The identification of the genetic changes that initiate the formation of cancer and the discovery of rare genetic alterations that drive cancers are, therefore, a challenge for the field. Another challenge is the acquisition of high quality biological samples necessary for genomic studies. , in particular for types of tumors that are rare or rare, or those that are not treated primarily with surgery.</p>
